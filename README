# Simon Game

Here is a fun memory game I created during The App Brewery's "The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp".

## Usage

The computer goes first and will press a button. It is then the user's turn to press the same button.
The number of buttons in the computers pattern increases by 1 each turn.
Enjoy!

## Acknowledgment
